# UniPlan

## 📖 Background

University students often need a timetable for classes and a task tracker for homework. Most tools keep these separate, forcing students to manually connect assignments with the related class. This leads to missed deadlines, confusion, and extra work.

## 🎯 Objective

To address the issue of missed deadlines, overwhelm, and confusion caused by the need to manage multiple timetables, particularly for university students, because most existing tools keep class schedules and task deadlines separate.  

UniPlan aims to provide an **all-in-one application** that integrates both class schedules and task tracking into a single, unified timetable.
